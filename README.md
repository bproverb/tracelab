Java Spring Web MVC app instrumented with Zipkin and Jaeger. 

## Details about the app

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. The project contains a managed MySQL (MariaDB) instance running on port 3306, an embedded AMQP broker running on port 8993, a frontend spring web instance running on port 8081, and a backend spring web instance on port 9000.

There are two sets of backend services instrumented with Zipkin and Jaeger each:
1. /api, /querydb, /putmq are instrumented with Zipkin
2. /apij, /querydbj, /putmqj are instrumented with Jaeger

The frontends call the respective set of backends and the endpoints are as follow:
1. / for Zipkin
2. /j for Jaeger

Traces will get sent locally so you will need to have zipkin and/or jaeger running:
1. To start zipkin
```
curl -sSL https://zipkin.io/quickstart.sh | bash -s
java -jar zipkin.jar
```

2. To start jaeger
```
docker pull jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.10
docker run   --rm   --name jaeger   -p6831:6831/udp   -p16686:16686   jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.10
```

## Building and Running the app

Once you have mvn installed run the following in the same order:
1. `mvn jetty:run -Pbackend`
2. `mvn jetty:run -Pfrontend`

This will start the frontend and backend webapps, the embedded QPid java AMQP broker, and the managed MariaDB SQL datasource.

Generate a few requests and check out the trace server UI
1. For zipkin
`curl -s localhost:8081/ -H'user-name:bproverb'`
2. For jaeger
`curl -s localhost:8081/j -H'user-name:bproverb'`

Once you generate traces you can access them at:
1. Zipkin UI
http://localhost:9411
2. Jaeger UI
http://localhost:16686
